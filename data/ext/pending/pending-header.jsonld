	"rdfs:comment": "The pending extension is a staging area for work-in-progress terms which have yet to be accepted into the core vocabulary.\n\n_Pending_ terms are subject to change and should be used with caution.\n\nImplementors and publishers are cautioned that terms in the pending extension may lack consensus and that terminology and definitions could still change significantly after community and steering group review. Consumers of schema.org data who encourage use of such terms are strongly encouraged to update implementations and documentation to track any evolving changes, and to share early implementation feedback with the wider community."
